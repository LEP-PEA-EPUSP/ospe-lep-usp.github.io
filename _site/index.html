<p>The open source power electronics project began at the Power Electronics Lab at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. It has started in 2015 with the development of an experimental platform for an undergraduate power electronics course. One of the ideas was to involve a few undergraduate and graduate students in order to develop this platform. In this way, it should be a platform done <em>by students for students</em>. The project has evolved to a modular power electronics platform which can be used by anyone wishing to learn more on this topic and even develop their own power converters and control strategies. In this moment, this project has already involved six undergraduate students, two graduate students and two teaching staffs. It has been divided in three fronts: hardware development, software development, documentation and learning. Feel free to follow this project and <strong>contribute</strong>!</p>
